title: "Correlation Data Analysis"
abstract: |
  This notebook contains the correlation data analysis of the cancer probabilities dataset.
  
  **Insights:**
  According to the correlation study conducted between habits and the likelihood of developing cancer, it suggests that smoking and alcohol consumption habits have a strong relationship with the probability of developing cancer. Conversely, habits related to physical activity have a strong negative relationship with the probability of developing cancer.

# Reading and setup

## Libraries and setup
```{python}
import os
import sys
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
from scipy.stats import spearmanr
from functions import calculate_spearman_coefficient, plot_ordinal_vs_target

# Set the default style
sys.path.append(os.getcwd()) # Add the current working directory to the path
# warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

## Reading The Data
```{python}
# Read the dataset
csv_path = os.path.join('cancer_probabilities_encoded.csv')
df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
```

# Data Analysis

## Spermans Correlation Coefficient
```{python}
# Calculate the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for all columns except 'probability_of_cancer'
results = {}
for column in df.columns:
    if column != 'probability_of_cancer':
        spearman_coefficient, p_value = calculate_spearman_coefficient(df, column)
        results[column] = {'Spearman Coefficient': spearman_coefficient, 'p-value': p_value}

# Convert the results to a DataFrame for better visualization
spearman_df = pd.DataFrame(results).T
spearman_df
```

## Correlation visualization
```{python}
# Smoking habit and probability of cancer
#| label: fig-smoking-habit-correlation

# Plot the relationship between smoking_habit and probability_of_cancer
plot_ordinal_vs_target(df, 'smoking_habit', 'probability_of_cancer', 'Relationship between Smoking Habit and Probability of Cancer')
```

```{python}
# Drinking habit and probability of cancer
#| label: fig-drinking-habit-correlation

# Plot the relationship between drinking_habit and probability_of_cancer
plot_ordinal_vs_target(df, 'drinking_habit', 'probability_of_cancer', 'Relationship between Drinking Habit and Probability of Cancer')
```

```{python}
# Biking habit and probability of cancer
#| label: fig-biking-habit-correlation

# Plot the relationship between biking_habit and probability_of_cancer
plot_ordinal_vs_target(df, 'biking_habit', 'probability_of_cancer', 'Relationship between Biking Habit and Probability of Cancer')
```

```{python}
# Walking habit and probability of cancer
#| label: fig-walking-habit-correlation

# Plot the relationship between walking_habit and probability_of_cancer
plot_ordinal_vs_target(df, 'walking_habit', 'probability_of_cancer', 'Relationship between Walking Habit and Probability of Cancer')
```

```{python}
# Jogging habit and probability of cancer
<#| label: fig-jogging-habit-correlation

# Plot the relationship between jogging_habit and probability_of_cancer
plot_ordinal_vs_target(df, 'jogging_habit', 'probability_of_cancer', 'Relationship between Jogging Habit and Probability of Cancer')
```

```{python}
# Correlation matrix
#| label: fig-correlation-matrix

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr(method='spearman')

# Plot the correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Spearman Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
